Hello to the first discussion! Since it's the first we'll just take things easy as we get used to things for the rest of the time. Some problems are just for fun! Enjoy!

### Problem 1

Compute $1 + 2$. Give me your best take on why you think what you do. As a generalization, what do you think the function $f(x,y) = x + y$ models? Based on the form, does $x$ influence $y$'s value? As an application, the payoffs from joe's day working are $x$ and the payoffs from phil's day working is $y$. What does the funtion's image $f(x,y)$ represent if joe and bob share the money?

### Problem 2

Consider the random variable $e^{X + Y}$ where $X \sim \chi^2_1$ and $Y \sim \chi^2_2$. What might the distribution of $e^{X + Y}$ be? $X$ and $Y$ are both independent.

### Last one!

Make sure you question that book! (Before things pile up...). Things can get worse when you have other demands, take it easy on yourselves. Knowledge, if you notice, is always here, ready for you and others to learn. Being a critical thinker is a little different. Don't buy what I say, the book says, nor anyone else unless there's a good reason for it.

Okay, see you later! Enjoy the day, take in the sunshine!
