Seriously, man. Life goes on. Whatever it is you aren't calm right now about, *it's not worth it.* How about a meditation break or just a relaxing activity to feel better? You owe yourself as much kindness as you would give others. I'll leave a buddhist quote to help you calm down:

> clarity is the tranquility of an enlightened mind, which makes right action possible.

This is just a course! And you are just going for a degree. The valuable things i am telling you is that the knowledge stays the same, and sometimes it isn't the best learned at certain times. No worries, you can always come back to it. It'll be here, sitting here, waiting...Let your mind come back to where it once was, it's possible!
