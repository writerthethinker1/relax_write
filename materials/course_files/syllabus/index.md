Hello and welcome to the basics of statistical critical thinking! We think you'll have a great time investigating old statistical problems from a critical perspective.

The course covers linear variables, transformations, real world analyses, controversial statistical mishaps, as well as applications to other branches of thought: physics, chemistry, and biology (for example).

In time, it is about 14-15 weeks and each week there's always something new for you guys to do! We won't go into grading just yet but a general outline of the times to follow are given:

1. there's going to be an exam
2. then there's going to be another
3. then a final one

> P.S: grades get in the way of true learning and we don't really know what makes a person smart. But, a good grade is a mark of diligence, something you'll need later in life frequently. (I sure did!). So earn a good grade, but have it out of your head until finals are over. Know where you need to improve first. Past that, it won't really matter; what you actually did during this time will!

Time and dates, we'll tell you guys later (2 weeks in advance). *If you have any problems with the dates, grading, and need adjustments. Just come up and ask or email us. We will work something out. Life happens, we get it.*

Contact information is given as follows:

But don't worry to much about them right now so much as actually understanding what you read. If it gets in the way of critical thinking, best discard it. The main reason you came was to think critically about statistical inference. Relax and enjoy thinking.

Wishing you well this term and life in general.

(Just a sample one, there for you to see how things look).
