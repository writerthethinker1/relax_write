For the first midterm, the most common subjects are: bayesian analysis, probability theory (integrals, verifications of density, applications), and matrix algebra. All at the level we've been discussing so far for the past 5 weeks.

We've added sample problems below. You guys are going to do great!

## Sample Problem 1

1. Bob likes to have bagels each morning. This time around, she has to pick between a chili bagel or a sweet one. Is it fair to say that

    $$
    \mathbb{P}(\text{chili}) + \mathbb{P}(\text{sweet}) = 1
    $$

    and if it is, why is that?
