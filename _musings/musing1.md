Back in 2016, there was something known as an *orthonormal base*. It's just a fancy way of laying a square grid on top of things. The basic condition is if $\vec{\alpha}$ is a 2-D vector and $\vec{\beta}$ is another one, they are orthonormal bases if and only if they are perpendicular. Nothing fancy.

You'll see them from time to time though.

I realllllly don't like computing those dot products because they take so much time. But, problems then had lots of them, oh well. Compute away! When this product is 0, we have orthonormal bases:

$$
\vec{\alpha} \cdot \vec{\beta} = 0 \implies \vec{\alpha} \perp \vec{\beta}
$$
