Someone in discussion asked, and we answered...

We know a formula for $\pi$ as

$$
f(\pi) = \sum (-1)^{x} \frac{1}{2x + 1}
$$

but suppose we loosen the criterion as follows:

$$
g(\pi) = \sum (-1)^x \frac{1}{3x + 1}
$$

how can we prove this too be a function evaluated at $\pi$? The first one is $f(x) = x/4$ evaluated at $\pi$. How about the second? It's okay to be wrong you know.
