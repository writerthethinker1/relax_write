In class the other day, the multivariate series for the last example was

$$
\sum_{(x,y)} x^2y + y^3x
$$

was supposed to be

$$
\sum_{(x,y)} x^2y + 3
$$

don't know where that one came from, silly note error. The domain of summing is $\lbrace 1,...10\rbrace \times \lbrace 2,...,5 \rbrace$. We'll talk more about derivatives for things like this one in discussion.
