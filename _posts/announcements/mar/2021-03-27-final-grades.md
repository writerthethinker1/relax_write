The finals are done! **Yes!!!** Back to fun things, right? Almost, let's take care of some bookkeeping...

They've been graded and submitted for finalization and to be put in your account records. Overall, not bad! There was no 'taking out questions' since it's at the difficulty we think is best given the way we learn and the other cool things we talked about. The mark you have is the real one for this exam and if you did better here, that's the one you'll keep. No worries if somehow you didn't, the way things are graded let's you have maybe at the lowest a 70% here, which is fine (basically, you learned and knew everything before finals, the last homework might have been the real final!! shhh!!!!).

The final scores summary is up [too!]({{ site.your_scores_link | relative_url }})


The overall grade adjustments have also been made and you can see them online. They're up.

**Send us an email if you think we made an error (meaning 10/10 practice problems and then 60/100 final, maybe error). You can also see us again if you are exam savvvy and want to see your exam again for errors.**

Thanks for learning well and wishing you all great times ahead, regardless of your score!
