Spring Break is coming up soon and there won't be anything assigned during the break, nice to relax just for that. If you have been struggling, you can also submit the *spring-make-up* if you've been having a hard time in the class. It's in the [practice section.]({{ site.practice_link | relative_url }}) It makes up for the last couple of weeks, depending on the one's you want to make up. Don't give up kind of mentality. If you do well, the higher score is the one you keep! No worries if you don't, the old one is yours, only for D-F scores. You can make up the first midterm too. Problems are a dime a dozen.

When we all come back, the first topic will be determinants as well as products of random variables...things like

$$
X \cdot Y \not \sim D_X \cdot D_Y
$$

as well as gradients of vectors and basic multivariate normal notes as it pertains to linear regression. Maybe

$$
\vec{\nabla}' \vec{v}(t) = \sum_i v_i'(t)
$$

and

$$
(X,Y) \sim \mathcal{N}(\vec{\mu}, \Sigma)
$$
