Since this class is packed, we're either going to move location or have to drop some of you guys. Priority is placed on whether you are planning on graduating soon. So, senior, fifth year and beyond can generally stay. If you're starting out in college, you might have to make plans for a back-up course. Again, we'll keep you guys posted as time goes. This is just to make things clearer. So many people! Glad to see an interest! Sometime by **Feb, 18, 2021** we'll know for sure what to do.

Until then, stay calm and know that the knowledge is already here. Perhaps the formal setting isn't. You can still learn though.
