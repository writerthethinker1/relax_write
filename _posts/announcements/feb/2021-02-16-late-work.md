If you guys hand in late work, we still grade it. But, on the day things are due: **turn in things you have done**. We'll keep those for grading and the ones later you turn in will be added. It's 10% marked down, the extra one's later. Don't let a deadline stop you from still learning. I'm not so picky about deadlines and dates to have things done, so it's more of a 'dead-interval' of 1-3 days. If you finish early, great, bonus point for you! But no worries if you don't. So, there's no final date for things to be done. Grading is more for you to see how well you have been learning what you wanted to learn.

Once upon a time, people kept looking at their grades rather than what they could do and how well they questioned what they learned! We're not there now.
