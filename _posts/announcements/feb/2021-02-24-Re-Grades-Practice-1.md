We're more than willing to look over your practice problems if you think there was a mistake when grading them. Just show up to office hours, either ta or me, and we'll see what's up. Time at the end of class works too.

Just make sure you get the request in by the **end of this week!** That's the time. Sometimes we make silly errors when grading lots of papers, it's common and don't be shy about it! It helps both you and us.

Catch you on the flip side!
