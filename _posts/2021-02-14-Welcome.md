Welcome! It's nice to see some people who value thinking critically. We'll be going over many things to come, basic procedures, grading things, and how the general way things go.

First, **all the things posted for the course are in the 'materials' section**. If you need files, syllabus, or other things: go there first.

You can find my contact information in the 'mail me' section and also read more about me (if you wish) in the 'about me' section in the upper right corner.

It's going to be a long and perhaps enlightening 14-15 weeks, best get cozy and familiarize yourself with the site and make contact at least once with the people in charge of your learning. Just once, at least.

(Just a sample.)
