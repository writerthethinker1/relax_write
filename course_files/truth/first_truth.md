The first lesson is the *truth of life*, what it is, applications, meditations, and how to realize it or at least begin. No matter what we do and how hard we may try, life is pain. Pain even when enjoying things and pain when not enjoying things. In order to do things, you must feel some sense of urgency to not do what it is that makes you not do anything. You'll find as you live life, this happens frequently. 

And that ends the lesson! Have a great day!
