<!---  add your title for musings (maybe "first compiler errors") and set the published to 'true' when you want students to see it or if you want to see it in your local server, all dates are numeral, so the only valid date is something like 2021-03-11 for March 11, 2021, keep the double quotes. other than that, the file is .md, so use markdown syntax and latex to write, no html, but you can if you want. --->
