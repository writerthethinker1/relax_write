The first quiz went well! You guys were able to recall the key concepts used over and over again in this course from basic symbolic logic: conditionals, ORs, ANDs, and basic rule following for derivations. One 1 problem had errors for a large portion of us...

## One error: De Morgan's Rule

Some people thought that de morgan's rule was

$$
\neg (p \lor q) \iff \neg p \land q
$$

when it is really

$$
\neg (p \lor q) \iff \neg p \land \neg q
$$

The first question in discussion will have 1 problem using De Morgan's just to illustrate it again. We'll make it entertaining...


Good work! Average was 80%!
