The first midterm was nice, you guys seemed to have understood most of the problems. The average was 70% which is nice. For those of you who didn't do so well, you can still do better, just make sure you go ask for help or come to us as tell us where you aren't exactly the clearest. Do it now while things are early! Later, it might not be so.

I could leave some graph or something, but let's just note where there were the most errors.

## Computing Confidence Intervals

Some people wrote the intervals backwards! We took off 1 point for that. Just make sure you guys know how set-notation works. Better here than at work.

$$
[a,b] \to \text{a first, ending at b: along a line, left to right}
$$
