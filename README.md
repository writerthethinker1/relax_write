# Pixyll.classes: pixylled for learning!

All adapted from [pixyll.com](http://www.pixyll.com) by [johno](https://johno.com). Check his original blog out! You can see other customization features there too! Social icons, formatting and other technical things.

It takes maybe 1 hour to learn, but once you do, you can teach many STEM courses. It has the basics for file storage, markdown articles, and many other features to make teaching and communication easy and accessible to those online or with a mobile phone access. It amounts to basic markdown file making as well as moving things into folders. Customization is also there in the _config.yml file.

## Basic Features

## Setting up Jekyll

## Formatting

### Formatting Posts

#### Announcements

### Changing Highlight Colours for Links (mood, own style)

### Using tags

### Easy Links (Syllabus, Notes, Week Notes, Articles, and so on...)

### Using the templates given

### Putting images in posts or lectures

## Uploading Material (really easy)

## Making Sketches

Sketches is a place to store articles, notes, announcements before release. All your drafts are located in the `_sketches` folder and won't be on the main class website. They don't have url's at all and are there just for you.

### Method of Learning

The method of learning places less emphasis on grades and more on what you guys have actually learned.

So, if the majority of people in the class can't solve or think critically about a problem, it's off the grading list and grades are high. Then, the problems are revised and given again as practice problems, definitely on the last exam as well.

> **If no one's getting any of the concepts, then there's no point in continuing further. The same re-done problems are coming back on the practice problems. That defeats the point of a course and makes it more for the instructor than the people who signed up.**

Basically, as a rough measure, I took the emphasis on grades and marks off. I took the nominal idea of one and gpa's and the other rubbish I didn't agree with off and went straight to the ideas and assume those who came wished to actually learn. I found things more relaxing and I learned better and was more creative by it. So, if you do score poorly, don't look at the score! Look more at what you didn't do, that's what led to it and be mindful of it. It's just a tinny course in the many other things life has. It's a no stress, chill place. Enjoy life for once and be creative.

There's also room for make-ups: alternate practice problems, and exams given during holidays for those struggling with D-F's. No make up finals, but everything prior can be made up. Problems and exams are easy to make so there's no trouble giving them to people who do want to do better. I found it sad to see others lose that 'will pass' mentality after some small poor marks. It's easy for me give them too, I just have to watch and see them. And there's not that many people, so it's just a day for me. Maybe a week end too? I'm fine doing that.

> But, you're free to go in your own direction with things, place emphasis on marks and and other things besides the problems and creative thinking that actually made the subjects you teach. I won't get in the way of your 'ego'.

But, I do share my personal tips for learning, I hope collectively they help others...

#### Wisdom

1. relate it to your goals
2. find one thing you like about what you are learning now
3. see how it can help you later in the future
4. take your mistakes easy, be mindful about them
5. find one question about what you've learned
6. tie it all back to the place you live as well as life in general
7. be okay with failing or being wrong!!! (wise people are).
