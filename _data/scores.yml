structure:

# if your class doesn't have practice problems, quizzes, midterms, or finals, you can set the 'show' part to 'false' to not have the header appear in the 'your_scores' section, or just take out the whole thing in the yml, more instructions about class customisation in the README.md, it's a whole guide!
