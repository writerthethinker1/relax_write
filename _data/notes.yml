notes_list_title: 'Notes'
structure:



# also the 'type' feature in the files in the _markdown_notes folder has to match the 'reference' part here for the file to show up in the right page, don't leave it out, the example files given all have them.

# if your class doesn't use some of the things here, like labs, extra things or coding, change the truth value in the 'show:' part of the yml to 'false'

# be sure to unpublish the homepage for the respective notes section to prevent the webpage from generating..., or just delete the parts in the _config.yml, here, and folders in the notes_upload, notes section for the part you don't need to the class, either way works

# the order you put things is the order it appears...
