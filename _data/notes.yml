structure:

#if you want markdown files in any of the notes subsections, just change the false to true and make sure the files you want uploaded go to the _solutions folder with the type: 'reference' in the yml

# also the 'type' feature in the files in the _markdown_notes folder has to match the 'reference' part here for the file to show up in the right page, don't leave it out, the example files given all have them.
